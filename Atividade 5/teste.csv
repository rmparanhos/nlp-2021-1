Energy I have edited the introduction because previously it said that passive transport does not use any kind of energy This is not true Passive transport relies on the kinetic energy of the substance that is being transported This kinetic energy is what causes it to move around and by random chance cross the membrane The difference is that active transport actually uses the cells energy ATP or electrochemical gradient to pump the substance across the membrane,0,1

balance This page has one sentence about the basic definition of the word and a huge amount about the slangprofane uses Perhaps the former should be extended is there no information about female dogs available beyond their name This is an encyclopaedia not a dictionary i feel that whoever is looking this definition up is very appropiate and should be deleted from wikipediaIMMEDIATLY this word is used very often and is also a very mean word i belive that is majorly true very much so okay so the good meaning is a female dog BITCH It also stands for the name Brittany FellowsPreceding unsigned comment added by etymology The word bitch is from the Old Norse Bikkjuna meaning female of the dog of unknown origin Grimm derives the Old Norse words from Lapp Pittja But OED notes that the converse is equally possible The adj Bitchy was first seen in The verb meaning to complain in Slang Bitchen good is attested to the s reclaiming the word bitch The word bitch is actually only offencive in American and Canadian English In most other English variants bitch maintains its correct definition female canine People have argued that bitch is different because it is used as an insult but so is pig dog cow and others These are not considered profane so why is bitch As far as I am concerned there is nothing to reclaim as bitch simply means a female canine It may be used as a pejorative or descriptor that does not make it a profanity It should definately say something about Kyle Vanderweilen and all his bitchin Is there any particular evidence of women reclaiming the word bitch in the s Can anyone point to articles on this etc The song is definitely interesting and belongs here but doesnt actually reclaim the word bitch any more than it reclaims the word sinner Also I dont really understand the last paragraph and it sucks I was going to try and clear it up but I realized I dont know what it means Can someone point to a source that lays out the argument about bitches fertility and patriarchy more clearly We dont need articles at all as I there are definitely enough examples even outside of the s Missy Elliot cleary and repeatedly reclaims the word for instance Shes a Bitch References are fine just the name Missy Elliot got me to find a quote of a rolling stone review that mentioned reclaiming the word In fact if some one knows more about her it might be interesting to add a section on her work and on how it relates to womenslurs more generally within hiphop How relevant is this reclamation It seems to me poison for a woman to use an epithet which still strongly connotes despised traits I dont see how using a word connoting querolous spiteful and malicious can be empowering But I dont know lifes a bitch It stems from a reaction to the prevalence of tagging any woman who doesnt adhere to a certain standard of femininity as a bitch To use a literary example in the novel The Handmaids Tale the narrator related the feeling that whenever she outsmarted a man she could almost hear him calling her a bitch in his mind even her own husband That literary reaction you recited is jealousy men have names for other men who outsmart them too but not having a word like bitch for them they have to resort to a greater variety of pejoritive epithets Though you havent been specific I think that standard of femininity you referred to is a pretext for subordination which both sexes often strive to impose on the other but men have traditionally had more power Because it is such a popular epithet in slang the connotations of bitch are diffuse though still commonly pernicious I think bitch in itself is not chiefly a denunciation to punish women who do not conform to that standard but rather a contemptuous word often used for it However I still dont see the point of reclamati,0,1

Ref SS Ponzi Scheme Hi Padillah It is not my opinion that I am trying to impose here although it may appear to be so I am just highlighting the fact that it remains controversial whether it is or isnt a Ponzi Scheme even if a legal one so you cannot state as a fact that it is not a Ponzi Scheme I saw the reference and the perpetrator itself cannot be treated as a reliable source In fact claiming it is not a Ponzi Scheme seems to be an opinion in itself My point is that a claim should not be made either way and the edit in question just accomplishes that Thank you Virat,0,1

Use of assisted suicide to refer to aid in dying is inaccurate in fourth distinctive ways First it was coined by Catholic activists disputing Oregons Measure in so it carries a political bias Second the laws in Oregon Washington and Vermont each do not contain the term assisted suicide but use aid in dying Third assisting a suicide remains illegal in all three states and also Montana and New Mexico No state attorney general or county district attorney has charged any physician or pharmacist who acted within the aid in dying laws of the three states Finally describing people who use aid in dying such as Brittany Maynard suicides grossly misrepresents their experience and devalues both their lives and deaths Continued usage of the biased and inaccurate term should be amended throughout Wikipedia,0,1

You wrote You will need to cite reliable sources for the assertions far too large to be chemical and no endothermic storage events I do not think any source can conclusively estabish either point It is very easy to establish both points and there are hundreds of papers with proof of them The limits of chemical storage electron bonds are well understood The most energy dense chemicals such as gasoline store to eV per atom Cold fusion reactions have often produced far more than this ranging from to eV per atom of the material in the cell and in all cases there is no chemical fuel before the reaction and no chemical ash after it finishes Cell with a few grams of inert material in them have produced hundreds of megajoules of heat as much as several kilograms of gasoline if you were to burn the cell contents they would produce only a tiny fraction of the heat In fact you could burn the cell the table and all books in the room and still get that much chemical energy Therefore chemistry is ruled out Any calorimeter can measure an endothermic event as accurately as it measures an exothermic event For example all calorimeters used in these studies show the endothermic formation of PdD at the beginning of the experiment Since the calorimeters shows the exothermic excess heat they would also show the endothermic storage that proceeds it They have never done this The heat balance is always zero before the heat bursts and after Jed Rothwell HERE IS more useful information that someone keeps erasing Please note that Cal Tech Lewis et al is a false negative as pointed out by Noninski Miles and Fleischmann This is described in several papers for example this one p Also the name is Julian Schwinger with ch See Jed Rothwell Librarian LENRCANRorg,0,1

Another priceless gem from yourself demonstrating your general cluelessness The fuse rating and therefore the plug rating in the case of a nonrewireable plug is determined by the cable attached not the appliance it will be used with Where on earth did you dig that nonsense up from There are plenty of good examples around but medium to large switch mode power supplies are often supplied with nominally Amp cable in a moulded on plug many with an IEC C type plug rated by that standard at Amps According to you the plug should therefore be fitted with a Amp fuse determined by the cable If you did so you would never get any but the smallest power supplies running You have to fit a Amp fuse because the very large Amp momentary inrush current lasts long enough that it will blow a Amp fuse The cable and plug can retain their original ratings because the inrush current will not harm them The rating of the fuse is determined by much much more than the cable size alone Indeed the type of power supply that is built into a plug usually has no fuse at all,0,1

Firstly still making undiffable edits and refusing to use edit summaries is becoming a behavioural issue that will need to be escalated if it doesnt stop Gun I really dont understand why you find it so hard to follow the basic standards of behaviour required to edit in a collaborative environment Secondly announcing changes on someones talk page doesnt really count as discussing them collaboratively rather it means you discussed it with me Furthermore I told you to go to the NPOV noticeboard to raise the State University vs University issue if you wanted to discuss the issue which you a failed to do b you removed the disputed tag from the article without a result as I suggested waiting until later c you made yet another diff which contained a large number of other unknown unknowable and undisucssed changes to the article,0,1

US Im trying not to just be a whinger and a hand waver here but it annoys me that theres an entire section devoted to left vs right politics in the US yet theres nothing similar regarding the rest of the world The US bias of wikipedia is very irritating sometimes though it shouldnt be as most Internet users are in the US In other words im a whiny European who is too lazy to write a non US section From the US Thats easy to fix Start writing more about nonUS views on topics creating topics and getting your friends to help Something that is created by users being called biased only reflects the predominant users posting and thus can easily be remedied Also from the US No its NOT so easy to fix Throughout Wikipedia you will see entries from obviously American authors who have no concept of a world view and automatically write from a US perspective without any attempt to qualify their language What therefore tends to happen is that the US view becomes a default with international views living in ghettoized paragraphs Also from the US That is actually kind of the problem with Wikipedia all around in the first place and that is that popular ideas are not necessarily correct You can have people posting information about the corruptibility of whatever organization but then the organization can have its people change the entry the next day Preceding unsigned comment added by This entire dicussion lends a great deal of credibilty to the idea that the leftright spectrum poorly represents political and economic views It seems to me that most of the debate below is equivalent to attempting to define the square root of negative with only real numbers at our disposal It is painfully obvious that politics is mulidimensional The most that can be hoped for here is to describe how the leftright spectrum is used and leave it at that This should probably be a very short article Preceding unsigned comment added by Better Chart I think that this page needs a metter chart Like this one Edit I actually think that the article in fact the whole political movement needs a better definition of leftright Most political parties cannot adhere to a single category including revolutionnary movements and farright groups as described somewhere else in the discussion I suggest a new use of the leftright compass The political compass uses the square system with two axis x and y social and conomic which is not very accurate because I know my political ideas and they tend to be pretty nearer to Mussolini than to Gandhi Whatever What I suggest is a cube axis x y and z conomic Social Politic The first one defines the market system if any of a political group The second defines the social standing of a political group about the welfare of the people welfare checkscharity privatepublic schoolmedical system etc The thirds one is basically the way a society treats its people rehabilitationpunishment democracytotaliratism in which I include Soviet Communism etc What do you think Preceding unsigned comment added by Interesting book I came across this book Left and Right in Global Politics by Alain Nol and JeanPhilippe Thrien I havent read it yet but it seems to be of great interest Removing unneccessary detail I am removing several paragraphs that are unhelpful to the article Edmund Burke terms left and right not used in UK then Adam Smith terms left and r,0,1

While profeminist men and profeminist writing generally constitute the dominant perspective within mens studies in the academy the shelves in the mens section of most bookstores are filled with books that come from two other perspectives namely mens rights and mythopoetic which share the basic assumption that what is wrong with mens lives derives from the traditional masculine gender role of protector provider and head of the family Kenneth Clatterbaugh Starting with Herb Goldbergs The Hazards of Being Male Surviving the Myth of Masculine Privilege there has been a steady stream of books that argue that men are not privileged relative to women The authors of these books claim either that men are just as afflicted by their gender role or that they are more afflicted by it than are women by theirs In either case mens rights defenders find a great lie at the center of feminism namely the notion that men are privileged relative to women Probably no writer has said it better than Goldberg who cites problems of traditional masculinity such as emotional repression isolation from other men fear of failure and a high suicide rate Kenneth Clatterbaugh The theme that was foundational to mens rights namely the oppressive nature of traditional masculinity has been undermined by fathers rights activists who want to pursue a set of custody rights and traditional masculinity Kenneth Clatterbaugh,0,1

I am not asking that the article itself draw any conclusions and the rest of your remarks are exactly the kind of synthesis that I desire My remarks are meant to move us past the conflict on the talk page Our sources are of course the verifiable secondary sources and we are not to do original research As CTSWynekan has said Wikipedia is a tertiary source Frankly its enough for me that the various Christian views are presented fairly and accurately the various Jewish views are presented fairly and accurately the various historical views whether by specialists or nonspecialists are presented fairly and accurately and all other views are presented fairly and accurately All should be given the appropriate weight and context That is enough of a synthesis for me But we all have our subjective views and many of our views have clashed hence we have been bogged down in one paragraph for far too long What bothers me is the binary thinking evidenced by some many not all which has polarized the debate We should also of course be sure not to confuse our various subjective viewpoints with the objective actual verifiable and factual as someone once said So in the end I essentially agree with you My remarks on thesisantithesissynthesis and the rest have to do with the debate on this page not with the article itself I want us to move past conflict so we can examine the verifiable sources and put aside our own views while still making sure that we any we are accurately represented as are the views of others To paraphrase Ross Perot everybody stop fighting and get to work If youll check youll notice that Ive done very little work on the article itself most of my efforts have been focused on the talk page NPOV when we reach it will be a synthesis accurately reporting the views of all and referenced to the appropriate verifiable sourcesThat said I have been as frustrated as anyone else and needed to vent my spleen which perhaps presented my POV more strongly than I have in the past Does that make it trinary My spleen has been vented My comments will remain on my user page at least until we formulate a second paragraph that does exactly as you say and is accepted by all It may go back if we run into further unresolved conflict My claim that it is a conundrum alludes to how the issue of historicity is handled at Socrates where any debate has been much more peaceful and civilized,0,1

Rob I actually like having you around for no other reason than you have a different POV from those with a Christian perspective However I also find you to be overly disruptive Yes I understand as well as everyone else your position that factual evidence does not exist Yes we understand that there are scholars that support that position No they are not the majority They are not even a significant minority They are a very small group that contends Jesus did not exist You have registered your POV and we are aware of it I ask that you now move on and address the article as a whole and accept that your position has already been accounted for in the article When you fight so hard and become so obstinate you lose the respect of your fellow editors and your POV is shut out almost completely You have become a source of conflict and contention Please recognize that your current methods are not working Find another way to interact with your fellow editors so that your POV is at least a chance of being heard,0,1
Um that is your opinion i belive DBZ tenchaichi and the last of the original bodikai for the PS bodikai is just as good as virtua fighter tekken DOA and other well known fighting games So come into reality and notice that everything you think is fact that is just base on what you think is highly unimpaortant and is mediocre in the eyes of others that actually do research on the subject You havent even stated anything about the game itself you just started of by saying thats a crappy series OR its not any good LOL Anyway even if you did your research with hardcore evidence that say these games suck huge balls or is poo and the games are a craptistic series and user Sabishi Kage is indeed a suck up and a yes man that is not neaded here on wikipedia And also if you two are going to start an edit war over something that is not even related to this article and is childish as Kim Kusanagi paragraph maybe you to should exchange your yahoo user names or myspace user names or whatever to argue BUT not here on this DISSCUSSION PAGE And Kim Kusanagi when you screw things up you deserved to be bashed and even physically punishedWOW you need therapy about child hood realated issues buddy mabey its because of your dad your mom or possibly your grandfather beating on you That is obviously some words said by someone that needs help mentaly most likely due to incidents done when you were a child I mean who say or even type something like that You have only added a useless sentence to this page until you came up with this paragraph that shows you have anger issues you used to get beaten on and you belive what you say goes without any research more clearly without say Get your facts straight LOL,0,1

Topics The Holocaust Anne Frank Diary Change of the Freedom Writers The Holocaust The holocaust occurred during World War II when Adolf Hitler was the dictator of Germany The holocaust is basically when millions of Jews were murdered during WWII and were intensely discriminated by Hitler and the Nazis However many of the Jews had resided in parts of Europe and many of them were residing in Germany but many of them were once again murdered by the Germans because Hitler plotted on disappearing all the Jews that were in the country This reminds me of how Ms Gruwell from freedom writers encouraged her students to learn and investigate about the Holocaust because not all of them knew about it or even believed it even happened and she wanted them to have confidence and knowledge about it that way they can become intelligent with the history of the event But some people never believed that the holocaust existed and others actually did Therefore a network of over facilities in Germany and occupied territory and was used to concentrate hold and kill Jews and other victims In addition after the beginning of WWII the Nazis began ordering Jews to live in certain areas of the cities in where many of them werent allowed to leave at all Also many of the Jews were held prisoners and had to be forced out of their residing locations and follow the orders of the Nazis or they will have to face death but the Jews faced death anyways and about million children were also killed during the holocaust due to Hitlers orders Also the first victims of the holocaust were homosexuals and people with disabilities and these victims were one of the first to be murdered during the event and there were also approximately more than million nonJewish victims living in Germany during WWII and as we said before the majority of them had to evacuate their places and relocate different areas In addition there were different kinds of camps such as ghettos concentration camps and even extermination camps where all the Jews were sent and were never free from any of the camps and the majority of all Jews had to suffer being trapped in these places where they would be tortured and harmed intensely and later on face death due to their residence in the country where they werent respected and treated kindly by the Germans and especially Hitler Also the Jews were the scapegoats of Germany collapsing after WWI meaning that the Nazis blame the Jews for the damage that has occurred to the country and Germany wanted to gain more power in order for them to become a more powerful strong country Anne Frank Diary Anne Frank was a young girl that wrote every detail in a diary in her life of the Holocaust She was sending a message to everyone or to whom that finds the diary I believe that she had a messenger to tell her what was going on outside Anne Frank was born in June in Frankfurt Germany She was born as a Jew and bringing a Jew was a very bad thing in the s because it was during World War I She was hiding because herself and her family didnt want to get killed so the hide for a while in a tiny place I dont understand why would they do this to this poor girl and her family that didnt do anything wrong Why hurt the Jews What did they do to get killed Change of the Freedom Writers Should Its amazing how the Toast of Change of the Freedom Writers has succeeded From a group of students who didnt care about school and becoming someone important in life to becoming someone better in life and helping other freshman students to do the same Most of the Freedom Writes shared the same story They didnt care about school they only care about surviving another day in Long Beach without getting killed Most of the Freedom Writes are teachers now in the area of Long Beach Many of them graduated from colleges others are part of the Freedom Writers Foundation They should be the perfect example of success to most teenagers in High School The reason why is because it was then when it all started From failing ditching class gang violence poverty and other domestic violence at home to SUCCESS For the most part most of them are doing very well They are teachers professors and other important positions someone can have They are living the toast of change Links,0,1

Sleeper Woody Allen film In view of its creator and star Woody Allen the movie Sleeper is satire of trends of the s placed in a futuristic setting Im giving as an anachronism a reference to a historical event the abandonment of clerical celibacy by the Roman Catholic Church in which a character finds a newspaper that refers to the wife of the Pope having children Such would not happen for at least years after the time suggested in the newspaper Nobody says that this movie is orthodox science fiction note that tobacco and junk food have been found wholesome and organic foods have been found harmful in an Orwellian world but a reference to a event that is shown to be impossible because a prediction of an institutional change that does not happen for a significant time later becomes an anachronism after,0,1

Thanks Hi Pburka You dont know me but I just wanted to say thank you for this comment you made at ANEW regarding blues edit warring report against me for edits on my own talk page Believe it or not she also reported my supposed edit warring at the vandalism noticeboard which of course was quickly dumped She has apparently been educated several times about what vandalism is but she continues to falsely accuse and report other editors of it And she ignored me when I educated her about WPRR and WPNOTRR I see that she also issued you a bogus warning just above this thread without a signature yet again She doesnt know the difference between WPPROD and WPAFD which doesnt surprise me because she warned me about moving a warning on my own talk page no less that was actually a template The most concerning issue though is that she only has or so edits most of them in the past four months and has shown a pattern of of rashly issuing warnings to and filing reports at various noticeboards about editors Even very experienced ones like yourself This pattern of hers seems to indicate that she prefers to go straight to noticeboards instead of having proper discussions with editors first even though some of the editors are vastly more experienced than her and the allegations are flawed Anyway just wanted to say thanks for the very onpoint comment you made,0,1

A few questions that need resolving regarding this article Why the inclusion of the actions of individuals Surely the point of corporate behaviour is that it is the action of a corporation in itself although these actions may not always be the intended ourcome of any individuals involved Furthermore whilst the effects of corporate behaviour on individuals may be a useful sociological side effect I do not see this as central to the issue of corporate behaviour I think an explicit division needs to be made between businesscapitalist corporations and noncapitalist corporations NGOs charities etc as I think the proposed rules of corporate behaviour can only be seen to apply to capitalist corporations If noone disagrees with this would people like me to attempt these changes removal of references to indiviudals creation of distinction between business and nonbusiness coporations Muppet,0,1

Did the jury understand that they did not have to impose the death penalty Juror said But its someone elses life and if Im wrong and I kill someone else I cant live with that The suggests that the jury may have held a misunderstanding In Florida a jury is able to recommended a life sentence instead of death A reporter on AC had a similar impression saying Did the jury really understand their role and suggested the judge may have been at fault This alone may not warrant inclusion in the article but more substantive references to this issue may be out there It would probably be OR to make such an assertion right now based on that statement More indepth interviews may take place in the future This should have been a bench trial The jurors clearly did not understand the law It is complicated in a circumstantial case I also think that a death penalty case is always a difficult case for jurors to decide Trial by jury is a right given the facts of this case and the prosecution putting the death penalty on the table it would have been foolish for the defense team to ask for a bench trial That is not what I meant If my life were hanging in the balance I would much rather put it in the hands of a judge This should never have been a death penalty case Not enough evidence to meet the criteria A jury is too unpredictable Most of the time the defense team thinks about how much money they will make and the publicity they will get which is also about money and lastly they think about the defendant To the prosecution and the judge it is about the truth and the proof Of course the defense team would not want a bench trial It would be best if we stay on topic then as our common goal here is to improve the article opinions that youd rather face a judge yourself or that the jurors didnt understand the law in this case or that most defense lawyers put their clients last to focus on fame while for prosecutors its about the truth isnt constructive on article talk pages However there are lots of forums on other sites that would welcome commentary Back to Xerxesnines point perhaps relevant material will show up in the near future Regards Both of us were engaged in speculation Xerxesnines point is just as speculative and mine Both of us have made several suggestions if you will look over this page All of us including youself should take your advice Excellent Im glad you agree and appreciate that youre going to work on that Regards Is there a Florida law that could counter the verdict guilty not guilty if it is found that the jurors did not follow the jury instructions On Nancy Grace there was mention of jury fraud the only example given was that if it was proven that their decision was based on what the bible says is rightwrong Jennifer Ford clearly didnt understand that this was the guilt phase and not the penalty phase furthermore there were plenty of other degreeoptions surrounding the murder charge that would not have inflicted the death penalty for which she couldnt live with Preceding unsigned comment added by With all due respect to Nancy Grace there isnt a chance in H that will happen The law of Double Jeopardy will prevent her of ever being criminally tried to these offences again She could be sued in civil court for wrongful death for money like OJ was but her parents seem to be delighted that she was found not guilty so I doubt that would happen I know this is speculation and will probably be told about it but I think this may not be the last time Casey Anthony will commit a crime User talkMugginsx,0,1

It actually matters very little whether the project members are coordinating to combat what they perceive as a liberal bias or simply coordinating to push a rightwing POV The practical result is the same this project organizes editors along specific ideological grounds and coordinates their efforts to advance that ideology A WikiProject which explicitly organizes editors by partisan political ideology while not categorically forbidden has an immense potential for abuse Not only have project members failed to address that potential constructively and proactively but theyve consistently and stridently refused to believe that any such potential for abuse existsThe more Wikipedians observe this project in action the more expressions of concern like those above youre going to receive because the way this project currently functions is inimical to Wikipedias policies and best practices and there appears to be zero desire on the part of active project members to grapple with goodfaith concerns Instead in keeping with the general battleground mentality embodied in this project the response has been to bunker down circle the wagons and hit back aggressively at any concerns that are voiced,0,1

Problem with Millenium Shakespeare article The title of the article is misspelled indeed but as a new user I couldnt edit it myself neither redirect the older article with the correct name to lead to the new version of the text I would appreciate any hints on how to deal with that Also I dont see where is the conflist of interest in the article Give me some hints Thanks The Sickness on Lost I mentioned it on my message that you left and think we should put it on the DISCUSSION page for anyone else to chime in on As said in that previous message I think that in fictional cases we have more leeway to speculate on stuff especialy when we are talking about LOST where answers are few and far between and often provide us asking more questions Randall Flagg Take out the picture of King instead A picture of the character seems more relevant than his creator especially seeing that as of now there are two images of him from the books two from TV one of King and none from the comics My image qualm doesnt stop with Palpatine and Jabba Those are older FAs that were established before the rigorous overhaul of fair use images in articles Per the actual criteria you need to have something about the image beyond simple identification the only exclusion to that is the infobox image My fear with the article in FAC is that criticism will arise about how influential this character is Kings novels yet how slim the article is on information about him If you feel it is ready then go for it The worst that can happen is that it is not promoted in which case you will most likely have a lot more eyes telling you what you can do to improve it thus making it that much better There is no draw back to not getting promoted other than not getting that little bronze star D Great work Hey I just wanted to commend you on the excellent catch you made in the Alice in Wonderland AfD discussion based on the new source you presented I switched my vote to Keep Great work has smiled at you Smiles promote WikiLove and hopefully this one has made your day better Spread the WikiLove by smiling at someone else whether it be someone you have had disagreements with in the past or a good friend Cheers and Happy editing Smile at others by adding to their talk page with a friendly message Dark Tower WP discussion Greetings Dark Tower WikiProject member I would like to invite you to palaver about a possible expansion of the Dark Tower Project to include all Stephen King related items I feel that the large amount of projects related to the author warrants his own Projectbut as this one already existshesitate to begin a new one Please feel free to leave comments of any kind and be assured that The Dark Tower will be held in the highest regard within the new King Project Long days and pleasant nights Saw traps From what I remember of the list it was just that a list of the traps There wasnt much there but original research and personal observation about each of the traps which is probably why it got deleted and rightly so If there was real content there then thats another story but I doubt that content couldnt be found on the individual film pages But if you feel that it was wrongly deleted then Id go to the deletion review page and start the discussion Maybe the closing Admin was a little hasty in his decision making UserBignole,0,1

Quite a while ago I had a nice book about the early history of rock and roll and it has a lot of content about Berry I cant remember any details bout the book I lost it in an airport somewhere long before I ever finished reading it I wish I could remember what the actual title was It was a bookstore clearance sale pickup I lose reading material in airports and on planes all the time When you get a chance could you look at an edit to Jimmy Page A editor who has been tagged as a sock of a blocked account keeps removing a string of sentences which appear to have several valid citations See this last edit The editor was blocked for breaking RR The person posted a reason on the talk page for the content blanking But their reason just seems to say it was OK for them to delete the referenced text because another user said it was OK to do so To me it just looks like an antiJimmy Page opinion edit and not an edit to help improve the page Could you look I think the edit should be reverted But the other day I noticed similar content removal and odd section altering so I reverted the back back to a version by YKcrazyjoker as that appeared to be the last version that was stable But I look today and see my edit was reverted by this tagged account and the edit summary claims my edit was some sort of sockpuppet edit You can read the edit summary To me it is very unclear If you feel that person is up to something and revert his blanking I would be curious as to what names he chooses to call you If I find a good Chuck Berry book in my travels I will post you Perhaps I can help you get that article into better shape Cheers and take care,0,1

That would be OR by prevailing standards yes though secondary sources that establish the history of the concept and talk about the existence of it prior to there being a name for it might be usable to bridge the gap What youd need ultimately is a source that gives a good account of trans history across various changes to how its been pathologized by the medical community Once you have that and have used it to create a historical spine for the article you would be on better footing fleshing out any given moment of history,0,1

November UTC Well Permyakia and Perm Oblast have established economic ties and a lot of common infrastructurethats one of the main reasons Also Permyakia is heavily dotational relying on the federal transfers to form a significant portion of its budget Problem is federal government is not always good with transferring funds timely which as you imagine creates all sorts of issues Perm Oblast on the other hand is a donor and once both budgets are merged it will ease the pain somewhat but note that during there will still be two separate budgets so there will be a transitional period Another thingPermyakia will still have a special status within new Perm Krai The main scoop is that Permyakia will no longer need to rely on federal governments transfers but will of course become dependent of Perm Krais budget and Perm Oblast will gain access to Permyakias resources The merger also lowers administrative costsinstead of two local governments there will only be one Considering that Russians and KomiPermyaks coexisted peacefully for quite some time there is something in this merger for both parties In a poll of people was conducted among the population of both oblast and autonomous district The most common promerger responses were because together is better because the common budget will create better opportunities for the territories development because the government will be able to build new bridges and roads and because there will be a reduction in the number of government workers,0,1

Update Tell Tyrone to check his messages A representative of the Wikimedia Foundation has made an attempt to contact Stephen Colbert through his staff In the meantime Im still gathering more information about the specific linking issue Lee Thats an edit summary in an admins block log not a message sent to anyone in any official capacity contrary to popular opinion some Wikipedians do have a sense of humor The message that was sent to him would represent an attempt to ascertain identity following an established procedure If Colbert wants to promote his site here all he needs to do is make a trivial effort to establish his identity to the Foundation which is already seeking to contact him as we speak Not that I have anything to do with this but I thought I might alert you to a simple way around this Lee Sheeh I apologize for not being more clear I didnt exactly expect you to go searching through miscellaneous site logs when I mentioned that someone from the Foundation was attempting to contact Colbert The Wikimedia Fountation is just to clear the nonprofit organization that handles Wikipedias business and legal affairs Theyre seeking to contact him actually over events related to the previous nights Wikiality discussion on the Report this is something I heard through the grapevine and not anything I know much about but I thought perhaps that if this site is indeed a scrappy little underdog of a marketing campaign for book whick Colbert considers his baby he or a representative might want to bother to have a fifteen minute discussion which would allow tekrelated information to happily coexist with Wikipedias policies He doesnt have to do anything he doesnt want to but since the folks at the tekjansen site seem to be somewhat preoccupied with the status of a single link here and have us listed as their top referrer despite the link being down half the time I thought the option might be of interest No huh Lee Reread the above I did not say they had to falsify the list in order for Wikipedia to be the top referrer I suggested a brief phone conversation might be worth the trouble if were generating the bulk of their traffic and theyre looking to promote Take a deep breath I also did not say Colbert has to verify his identity in any way However since the site seems to fail several points of our linking policy yes the site is likely to be removed without additional information being provided Im sorry but the its relevant anyway angle is fairly weak the only reason this material would be an especially relevant resource on Colert would be if it was actually Colberts writing It does not have information on anything relevant to Stephens biography Generally speaking we dont count fan forums as an invaluable unique resource see WPEL That leaves the book which while possibly being Colberts is irrelevant if its not I could write a novel about Charlene and post in on my website and that would also not be relevant Or a novel about Stephen Colbert for that matter In any case Im sorry that for some reason I seem to have pissed you off I have no idea why youre so angry about this but I assure you again as I have assured you before its nothing personal Lee My AMA request which you seem to have found was a private request for advice on how to handle a situation which has become somewhat tense You are welcome to conduct a straw poll if you want I havent followed through on that personally because Ive already have openly solicited comments from editors at the Colbert talk page and believe we already have a pretty good index of what most experienced editors think of the link But go for it As I have stated before if theres a consensus to add the link I wont remove it I never never ever not even once said that I will refused to allow the link unless myself or a Wikipedia official is contacted by someone at the Colbert Report so please stop misrepresenting my remarks In the meantime there is absolutely nothing wrong with my asking another user for help and it does not represent bypassing a regular process You are welcome to file,0,1

Ok dokey This revert puts us square on the discuss portion of the BRD cycle I feel that my changes arent broadly transformative to the POV of the article that they improve the flow for reasons posted above and that they can be supported by either side of this business I see that this change specifically could generate some consternation and Im more than happy to put that on the back burner though a big quote shouldnt be leading the section IMO If I dont see some discussion here Ill assume that silence implies consent and go back to improving the article,0,1
I think you misunderstand and I already changed the article from what it said before Before it listed her in shorthand as Chase Smith like Chase Smith did this and Chase Smith did that Theres no doubt that she used the name Margaret Chase Smith in lieu of Margaret Smith which I have never heard but her last name was always Smith and she was Senator Smith not Senator Chase Smith some books have referred to her as such but I cant find anything from her or the US Government The sources you provide show that she was categorized as Smith Margaret Chase with Chase being treated as a middle name as wasis common for many married women not a part of her surname Thus I think the shorthand for Margaret Chase Smith remain simply Smith or Senator Smith or whathaveyou and Chase Smith Unless of course Im still missing something,0,1

Well my opinions worth exactly what you paid for it since Ive never edited that article But Im not sure why this needs to be analyzed within the COI framework at all This doesnt appear to be about someone pushing for their specific acupuncture clinic or whatever so its not clear to me that this is any different from any other general POVpushing case I suppose the issue I have with the COIrelated discussions Ive come across lately is that they all turn the conversation from one about edits to one about the interests of the reallife person behind the edits Those interests are difficult to identify often unverifiable and not always easily stuffed into the COI box,0,1

Compromise Would anyone have a problem with keeping the current arrangement Johnson in the title Ocho Cinco in the text until consensus can be reached Yes Having title saying A and text saying B is just messy and unencyclopedic Both the title and the text should read the same name I would immensely prefer it stays Chad Johnson until were week or two into the NFL season and we see what Chad is predominantly called by the media and then fix the article accordingly when consensus backed up with sources is reached I am however perfectly willing to help transition the article to Chad Ocho Cinco if he is indeed called Chad Ocho Cinco or Ocho Cinco by the majority of journalists and broadcasters but I would like to see reliable sources calling him Ocho Cinco before we change the article My feeling is that the guy is named Ocho Cinco and whether you think its dumb or you think hes an attention whore that is in fact his name If you enter Chad Johnson in the search bar its goiung to direct you here anyway so whats the big deal And another thing Why is the page titled Chad Johnson and yet he is referred to as Ocho Cinco all throughout the page,0,1

The whole concept of blocking and banning is an anachronistic tribal practice that not only predates the advent of the Rule of Law its the very subject of the first three laws ever carved onto stone tablets some years ago Hammurabi of Mesopotamia These are the first three laws in their entirety of the Code of Hammurabi translated into English If any one ensnare another putting a ban upon him but he can not prove it then he that ensnared him shall be put to death If any one bring an accusation against a man and the accused go to the river and leap into the river if he sink in the river his accuser shall take possession of his house But if the river prove that the accused is not guilty and he escape unhurt then he who had brought the accusation shall be put to death while he who leaped into the river shall take possession of the house that had belonged to his accuser If any one bring an accusation of any crime before the elders and does not prove what he has charged he shall if it be a capital offense charged be put to death The second law seems bizarre by modern standards It appears to be the source of the dismissive phrase Go jump in the lake Compare to the Yiddish expression Nem zich a vaneh Go take a bath Go jump in the lake There are such laws in the Code of Hammurabi each no more than a sentence or two The laws are bracketed by a pukeworthy Prologue in which Hammurabi introduces himself and a narcissistic Epilogue in which he affirms his authority and sets forth his hopes and prayers for his code of laws Note that Wikipedia is not even as evolved as Hammurabi since Wikipedia does not even do the level of due process required of Hammurabis first law Given that Wikipedia has adopted an anachronistic preHammurabic tribalistic ochlocracy that does not even rise to the level of the Code of Hammurabi is it any wonder that Wikipedia is the venue of recurring classic liminal social drama that reprises the oldest stories in the annals of human history Hammurabis notion was to advise everyone to go jump in the lake when they are tainted with an unproven allegation I reckon the secular cultural practice of absolution through ablution inspired the Early Morning Baptisers of Qumran to coopt Hammurabis Remedy into the Mikvah Ritual Bath Baptismal sin cleansing survives to this day in most Christian denominations Of course there was that interlude in the desert where there were no bodies of holy water so Aaron devised an alternate ritual involving a delightful goat named Caprice I am rather fond of Caprice since her story inspired portions of the Passion of Christ I find it ironic that a site that purports to offer the sum of all human knowledge is still struggling to learn the oldest lessons in the annals of human history So I suggest people wash their hands of Jimbos anachronistic cult of preHammurabic tribalism cleanse themselves of the grit by jumping in the lake and evolving to a more modern and enlightened governance model along the lines suggested by such innovative pioneers as Moses Socrates Buddha Jesus Lao Tsu Maimonides Thomas Becket Stephen Langton Benjamin Franklin Thomas Jefferson Henry David Thoreau Mohandas Gandhi ML King Thich Nhat Hanh John Rawls Father John Dear Barak Obama Kermit the Frog and Barsoom Tork Associates Barsoom Tork,0,1

First paragraph The first paragraph is lacking description and has misleading information The website is powered by Google Custom Search It is not developed by Heap Media as the article claims the code has been written by Google Blackle simply provides the domain name I also added a summary that described the principle of the website as per WikipediaLayoutFirstparagraph but it has been reverted,0,1

Ariel I am not trying to sound like a cock here but bite me It doesnt look like your an Admin but I could be wrong I was watching NASA TV when they announced the scrub so I added it What the fuck do you think it is that I speculated I speculated nothing On NASA TV they said the launch was scrubbed due to the leak that is not speculation that is a fact As for breaking news edits you have done twice as many edits as me in the past hour updating every little thing so who is being abusive there Just admit it if you cant be first to edit articles in your favorite topic your life would have no meaning I get that there are a bunch of you wienies here that is what ruins this site Again not trying to be a cock but I take offense when someone accuses me of doing something wrong when they are the one doing it,0,1
No Mention of Abolitionism Given the subject matter of opposition to the treason claims levied against Southern soldiers the Civil War and the involuntary Union shouldnt Spooners ardent abolitionist views be mentioned to give this article proper context I say it is absolutely essential Otherwise he could be easily painted as proslavery a racist or proConfederacy He was none of those things,0,1
To When you accuse someone of slander please specify the false facts being asserted Please do not make unfounded personal attacks This article seems to bend over backwards to be fair to Breggin For precision written defamation is libel not slander An unfounded accusation of defamation is defamatory Try being specific and precise for credibility,0,1
Are you kidding I looked in the archives and found multiple instances of you referring to the edits that I had made as me agreeing with you thats just BS I only referred to you once previously in drawing a conclusion any other reasonable person would with respect to your edits Your claim that any and all nations that were formed from what was once the Soviet Union should be considered as succeeding the Soviet Union has one big flaw the Baltic states were already formed before the USSR was even created A reader who will look at the infobox to see what countries came into existence with the dissolution of the USSR will be misled because the the Baltic states already existed since In fact the notion that the Baltic states only came into existence with the dissolution of the USSR is considered Russian nationalist POV in RS And again how do you know readers do not care about the technicalities in the matter and omitting anything or separating them is not useful to the lay reader it is obvious that you do not care but dont project this unto the reader This is an encyclopaedia after all readers come here to be educated and informed,0,1

So on the tenth anniversary of New York Times columnist Paul Krugman delivered the odious piece of dribble ever on the attack well at least since the last time he wrote about it The headline is quote The Years of Shame end quote And no its not directed at radical Islam Instead he targets America and the quote fake heroes Krugman claims that the atrocity has been hijacked The sick word given that hes not actually talking about the real hijackers who killed some Americans No hes referring to people like George Bush and Rudy Giuliani who he thinks capitalized on the horrible crimes But the worst part at the end of this column the creep writes Im not going to allow comments on the post for obvious reasons That obvious reason hes a coward I mean why else would you ban responses Hes like a yearold boy crankcalling all of us only to hang up even before he hears a response hearing his shame for his own wickedness Now I watch the memorial services and I feel sorrow for the families whose grief never really ends But since Im lousy at emotional reflection I usually avoid it But at least I can summarize what many feel today in nine words go to hell Paul Krugman you bearded bitter buffoon,1,1
