Before you start throwing accusations and warnings at me lets review the edit itselfmaking ad hominem attacks isnt going to strengthen your argument it will merely make it look like you are abusing your power as an admin Now the edit itself is relevantthis is probably the single most talked about event int he news as of late His absence is notable since he is the only living expresident who did not attend Thats certainly more notable than his dedicating an aircracft carrier I intend to revert this edit in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself and not throw accusations around quite so liberally Perhaps if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully,0,0

Reconsidering st paragraph edit I dont understand the reasons for s recent edit of this article not that Im sure that the data are necessarily wrong Rather Im persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly enhanced and I also believe those changes are no improvement In support of my view that this edit should be reverted I would invite anyone to revisit articles written about the following pairs of jurists A Benjamin Cardozo A Learned Hand B John Marshall Harlan B John Marshall Harlan II The question becomes Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them or either pair be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph I think not Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point Less humorous but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale At a minimum Im questioning this edit It deserves to be reconsidered,0,0

Not at all you are making a straw man argument here I never claimed ODonohue had that position rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position which is exactly what the quote says and also something ODonohue agrees with Again I was combating the notion that it was a absurd part to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation Since many researchers hold this position it would be unfair to call it absurd The disorder part is divided in the field some argue that it is not a disorder at all some do At the end of the day it is a value judgment as Cantor pointed out earlier in the thread not a scientific judgement If we choose to make this value judgment in the article it should be stated clearly and not pretend to have a scientific basis,0,0

Jmabel in regards to predominant scholary consensus who is it that allegedly claims despite Third Way rhetoric fascism in power functioned rather consistently as a rightwing force As far as Im aware owning numerous books on the subject that is not the scholary consensus at all The consensus developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin Hamish McDonald Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a Third Way as the references show The only dissenters Im aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books For example even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy Renzo De Felice doesnt try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini,0,0
BI you said you wanted to talk At the bottom of the lead section you have written Its promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts In addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials Regarding In addition the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials That statement appears to come from Ref on page The full quote is If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures It then goes on to say As we shall see presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL tethers needed The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is We dont need magic materials like BuckminsterFullercarbonnanotubes to make the space tether facility for a HASTOL system Existing materials will do So it would appear that you misread your reference The tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem Systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is technically feasible We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic airbreathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into Earth orbit For more than one HASTOL architecture concept we have developed a design solution using existing or nearterm technologies We expect that a number of the other HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of Earthtoorbit space access Regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts and A Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that In general the nonspinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts The full quote is HyperSkyhook In Zubrin proposed the Hypersonic Skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers Since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,0,0

Is it scientific to attribute an event A to cause B where cause B was deliberate designed with some sort of intelligent intent Dont answer the questions beyond that Well the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged There are several major fundamental problems here First you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth Natural science might look at a honeycomb see it is built by bees and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here This is not science in any sense of the word it is mythology When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes No evidence of paul and his ox remain i mean really Second natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria If you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone MUST have designed it This is such a perversion of science You can assign probabilities to something you dont understand ID is just making up their numbers Finally your example has AB where B was deliberate design thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth B is unknown Your AB example might qualify as forensic science if A were a dead body and B were a bullet in the heart You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the heart you can probably figure thats what killed him You dont have that with life on earth You have ONE scenario A and you have no other cases to observe or test So in that sense AB is not scientific if youve never actually observed B btw B is teh intelligent designer which has NEVER been observed So in that sense no it isnt science,0,0

Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized However the term fossilized is not a very precise term There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc And multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc Talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned The major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains Yet how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with,0,0

Ahh Hello Witzeman Symbols m m Characters Greek Cyrillic IPA t d My Famous Article witze happiness wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families regardless of race age character or knowledge The outside world knows little about these elusive characters and the honour of the Witzeman For those who have ever been a Witzeman it has been said to have been a great honour although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman The Present Witzeman is an yearold boy namely Benjamin Woods who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this awesome radiance in his topright bumcheek He has not told a great number of people his testimony but has promised to do so in years to come History The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time The term Witzeman is a compound word of the adjective Witze and man witze being an th century term for a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence Unfortuneatly Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind for unspeakable reasons Proper History As early as the th century Witzemen were considered outcasts and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks This led to the st Witzeman Rebellion of when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced gaga at a Government meeting that year The period from here to the early s was a dark time in the Witzemans history However good times were to come for the Witzeman Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the s building up to a great moment in the historythe Great Rebellion of This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons wearing clown masks but otherwise completely naked This was thought to be an act of circambulation However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour were mentally spiritually and emotionallly scarred for life This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability suffering from trauma It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman In a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased Although this was a formal agreement many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted,0,0

Attributing and classifying of personalities Invitation Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain wellknown ideological systems may raise here I propose a quite liberal variant of it where definition may not be connected with one certain word Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains My initial ideas on this branch the ones concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period Some artists writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as modernists This definition is not false but some more concrete things should be added some specifics of Lithuania We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat Renaissance from later modernism which is more known for us Cultural aspirations of the later Nat Ren may be defined as modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage and their expression may be seen as something simply typically Lithuanian I mean that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context but it also and even more is a representative of Lithuanian culture when in European or Worldwide context A parallel example may be taken from literature of India Poet Tagore well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture But in his own country he was seen as a modernist too who was changing traditional cultural forms especially stagnated ones This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N Ren could be seen as modernists which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones in Lithuanian context They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture iurlionis is the best example here In other way the later Lithuanian modernists they depended mostly to later generation approximately from th decade of the th century concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose looking generally was to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life see the table below We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here The problem is that both movements collaborated especially their political wings did and interchange of ideas between them is well seen So many researchers dont pay attention to this difference Especially in the Soviet period when national ideas were officially forbidden mixture in description of these movements was allowed E g philosopher Ramnas Bytautas who clearly depends to the first generation is often described as liberal And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation as idea of liberalism period and generation artists writers philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period the younger generation approx painter and composer iurlionis painter Kazys imonis poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas Vydnas dramatist Sofija Kymantait iurlionien poets Adomas Jaktas Motiejus Gustaitis Liudas Gira composer Stasys imkus philosopher Ramnas Bytautas reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture almost unknown before them The period between WWI and WWII and postwar years poets V Mykolaitis Putinas Kazys Binkis writer Ignas einius Jurknas artists all ars group philosopher Juozas Girnius Modernists introducing new Western ideas into Lithuanian cultural life Central European modernism Note Lists of personalities isnt complete here nor its made precisely by prominence Jul UTC,0,0

Randroide Answers to Next Step Guys I do not see you taking steps to WikipediaRequests for mediation I can not do this job because I always connect from filtered institutional netaccess and following those steps could result in new undesired controversial truncation of words by the software I do not want that happenning Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided Thank you Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas At last we agree on somethingof course that the new section is a good idea The false suicidal terrorists from PRISA will also be included there Come oooooon boys start writing that section I do not want all the kudos for myself The new proposed article is by now an effort made only by me But remember NPOV and sources all the sources Just like me citing El Pas in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb Cheers Indeed a good point And all the remarks in COPE too And the moral certitudes of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo I agree with you Larean What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so the original version he created was entirely POV as is much of the rest of the proposed article Also all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers NPOV it is not You are right Southofwatford in your Randroide omits section If you have not subscription to El Pas I am sorry but thats your problem My institutional access also has some advantages like paid access to El Pas and many many other publications and books Thats one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered Internet accesss Its much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources Do you see The truncation of words is offsett I think by better sources BTW if you write under a Randroide answers section you are Invading my space I do not mind really But you are doing it Risking new truncations on your messages To avoid this please write OUTSIDE Randroide answers sections If you think that the proposed article is POV work in it to make it NPOV The article is not mine Ill take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here its very short The issue is not whether I subscribe to El Pas its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is to my mind completely unreasonable All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article Very funny Southofwatford I am going to follow this joke of yours Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources because did you know there is always someone without this or that book Delete all references to TV or radio stations because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home Delete all the references in spanish because did you know there are users who know no spanish Its a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes really I had a good laugh UserSouthofwatford How strange that you should find it so funny after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny its simply bizarre Equally in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response,0,0

The organization of subtopics Culture is thrown way down towards the end after economy and tourism which is inappropriate The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography which makes it not only uninteresting but also repetitive Information is interspersed all through the subsections without regard to whether or not they fit there Eg the Geography section starts with the fact that UP is the th largest state That is not strictly geography and belongs in the introduction Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page perhaps before toursim Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination In any case Cities of Uttar Pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own because UP has several interesting cities and regions each with specialities of its own like the copperware of Moradabad ceramics of Khurja and carpets of Bhadohi In fact I remember there used to be such information in the article before,0,0
I dont know the answer to this but Legally how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizens civil rights I dont know if this is the section Nelson was charged under in the federal case but if anyone could explain this I would appreciate it You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified thats really not my concern here since its a dead letter Im concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice its not the first time Look at Issei Sagawa Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isnt perfect and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted and that guilty people will be acquited from time to time Thats the price you pay for having a legal system in the end someone has to make the decision and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right I dont think its going out on a limb to say that the Sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief,0,0

s rant Presently we are witnessing an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture Croatian Left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being in service of Conservative HDZ party Croatian writer Predrag Raos for instance performed on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition Another apostle of Croatian Left Miljenko Jergovi refers to his political opponents on the Right as gusle players Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda all tokavian people and their culture are Serbian However Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture For example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music Marko Kraljevi is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorovis book Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje Also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in Dubrovnik Even now a contemporary Croatian writer born in Dubrovnik Stijepo Mijovi Koan tells us a story about his uncle also from Dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs Stijepo Mijovi Koan Gusle Glasnik May p Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin born Kalafatovi a daughter of famous gusle player Ante Although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry Not far from Dubrovnik another coastal city Makarska was also a bastion of Croatian gusle music Actually this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players This Mediterranean area also gave birth to Andrija Kai Mioi th century Catholic priest who is viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond To honour Kais work Ivan Metrovi the most famous Croatian sculptor built a sculpture in America showing Kai in his priestly clothes playing gusle instrument In addition to Kai Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music According to dr fra Karlo Jurii who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banovi Zaostrog alone produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan KosoviKudri and culminating with the most known Mate Banovi Trli As for Dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading gusle music by imitating its sound Olinko Delorko the researcher of Dalmatian folk poetry in the s states in his book Ljuba Ivanova that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by women especially the ones from the island of Hvar The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition English writer Maude M Holbach travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of th century states in her book Dalmatia The Land Where East Meets West that the gusle was the national instrument of the region As for Dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe p This admiration for Dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and Hinterland Matija Murko the researcher of this literarymusic forms had reported that during his trips through Dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle Eduard Osredeki Hrvatske narodne junake pjesme eljeznoBe p Now lets take a look at the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations Hajduk Junak Gusar Alkar Uskok sinjska alka etc What do they have in common Of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region Having this in mind one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost extinct Why do we have so few gusle players today Is it a result of unavoidable urbanization of modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered inferior to global rock n roll culture If so why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its Dinaric counterpart gusle music is looked upon with suspicion and open hatre,0,0

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections Standfordham wrote to the King on October I saw Mr Baldwin who in reply to my question Do you want to turn the Government out said Yes but not on the Campbell issue but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns He sees no alternative to a dissolution it has always been expected some wished for it before now though he is opposed to hastening the Governments fall And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwins strictures based on the Campbell case at Newcastle on October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement achieved at a conference in London on the Dawes Plan for reparations and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour partys subservience to its extremists and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement But the final debate on October was a mean Parliamentary occasion Two days before in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominenceMiddlemas and Barnes p,0,0

Wrong The capital is Podgorica as it has always been since July The seat of government parliament AND PRESIDENT is in Podgorica Cetinje is only the seat of the Kingdom of Montenegro in exile And besides only capital cities have embassies and Podgorica has them and do you see any in Cetinje no Besides no one in Montenegro nor in the world say that Cetinje is the capital of Montenenegro but instead they say it is Podgorica And also that consitution was adopted in very outdated and a new one is due next year,0,0

Can there be a more concise listing The listing of other inventions is profoundly vague Why group different categories together Why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources There should be a much more complete well managed list of chinese developments which Ive yet to find along with how these were transmitted globally and whether or not places like Europe got them purely from the Chinese This really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise which I guess is somewhat there when Needhams work which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles And besides why are things like the cannon and porcelain listed under other inventions Who developed these independently,0,0
In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity while theology makes no such claims It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means so in principle their view is notable but as Enns said it is a fringe view in the academe even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources therefore JEDP and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WPUNDUE This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong Wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view Of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes So in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism They are free to do this but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians,0,0

While I agree that Indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying Second there is no proof at all that the mighty Sarasvati of the Rigveda was in fact this now dry river the identification is itself open to doubt Apart from there being factsproof to indicate that Saraswati did exist as this dry river including geological facts as to why it dried up The evidence also points to the fact that it was NOT a tributary of the Indus refuting point of the passage quoted above and in fact drew the waters of the Sutlej and the Yamuna to be a river system of its own And though a large number of sites have been found along this river system none of them are of the scale of Harrapa Mohenjodaro leaving the Indus Valley tag as the correct one Saraswati did existtoday the timing is disputed and not the existence Wheter it is vedic and indic vs Harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than its existence,0,0

Tim firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in there is clearly a massive diffence between say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions or between the Chinese and US jurisdictions since the legal and regulatory systems are very different as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in say Paris or Toulouse even though they are both in the same jurisdiction I appreciate that the situation in the US is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though To give an example the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist niche and focused on high tech To give another example in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didnt have an office in London even if it had offices in every other big city In fact all of the very top tier UK firms DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them despite its size have just one UK office in London although they have other offices overseas Saying that DLA has has offices across the United States Egypt South Africa Kenya Thailand China would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader We could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness imprecision and even original research I do accept that DLA with offices is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it and should be included as much as possible,0,0

It is unnecessairy source because it does not matter how many soldiers were killed What matters is that the Safavids were deposed Besides that mentioning that information WITHOUT making any remarks about the brutality of the Afghan forces for example the complete massacre of the Safavid family including women and children as well as the massacres on the civilian population in Isfahan Bam and villages of Khorasan is considered POV Besides that you have not shown any sources for your claim that soldiers were killed And as for the edits it does not matter what YOU believe it only matters what the Wikipedia rules are You posted a message without editting ANYTHING thats the same as abusing the articles history as a messageboard Use the REAL messageboard instead,0,0
Whoever wrote the Plot I feel terrible for whoever had to watch the movie in detail and then write the plot line Who ever took their time to write the plot section must be traumatized for life However its missing the part where Milos son is laying on his belly unconscious on a bed Milo anally rapes him while several masked men watch Also theres some use of a knifesword in this scene This is truly one sick film No there is no artistic message This film is basicly a middle finger by the sickminded film makers The cast must have been tricked into participating in this disgusting film Theres artistic gore such as the classic film Begotten and then theres this Listen to me DONT WATCH THIS FILM NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU ARE TEMPTED,0,0

meters sigh and my concerns Only because Mr meter had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far I did not have a single chance to develop it His article called falsetto is not about falsetto It may be about his arrogance who knows There are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr meter such anxiously protects In England Italy or Spain th century were described entirely different types of falsettos On the top of it Mr meter perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto or the falsetto of Ian Gillan Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto What about Michael Kiske Is it not falsetto Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do did not sing falsetto Does any of these falsettos sound breathy Not to me Isnt out there published a note about those Maybe only because meter does not look for it Why It would not fit to his article He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk meter quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World The whole physiology of his only falsetto is based on encyclopedia Well perhaps it is enough for Wikipedia or himself But not for me No There is much more out there only regarding physiology Much much more And just because you allow idiots like meter to develop Wikipedia the people the readers of Wikipedia will read shit Where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at ies Mr Know Everything Feel free to block me again I have no desire to write here any more,0,0

Removed POV I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead The following has been removed from the article Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception Henry Adams wrote in a muchquoted analysis in He believed in common schools and not in political science in ledgers and cashbooks but not in Adam Smith or Mill as one might believe in the multiplicationtable but not in Laplace or Newton By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusionsHenry Adams The Session North American Review July p But in a very corrupt time it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post either for himself or his friends Living within his salary he lodged in a boardinghouse throughout his tenure His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker though never for money Chicago Times March He is an inaccessible man uninfluenced by fear favor affection or hope of reward and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred a New England politician wrote his brother Henry F French to Benjamin B French March Benjamin B French Papers Library of Congress Boutwells financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmaticLiberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses,0,0

Question on Possible Citation Im sorry if I missed your question I dont pay much attention to that page In response to your question let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view I havent yet worked in no original research WPNOR says that we mustnt integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research We can integrate information so long as we dont arrive at new theories Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate Getting down to details the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source The Bauer site even if somewhat unreliable may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer Im not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable The sources are sufficient and no original conclusions are made The website takedown issue is confusing to me but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources Overall my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better Attack articles are not encouraged While we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldnt enlarge the warts nor ignore their better features Balance is a part of NPOV but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer It isnt clear if she did and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs I dont see how that can be objective Bauer Im sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al but Ive been somewhat overloaded at work Personally I think the article is better now than when I first saw it thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesnt seem like a lynch mob Yall are doing a good job and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted Im glad to help and try and make the article neater and I dont mean to sound brusque in the summary field but there was a lot to cram in there Thanks for the note I appreciate it I would say Karen saying Ive called her names is an out and out fabrication Ive never done any such thing or whether its because hes been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia repeatedly and without consequences Ive accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have That isnt namecalling by a long stretch Im really weary of these attacks over this This is mob rule While avi seems genuine shes hanging with a tough insulting tribe The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour Blaming me wont make my points any less valid Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd Its the Internet equivalent of stoning This is not a fabrication I get awfully tired of being called a troll or part of a mob or cult or group troll or a selfinterested partisan or a blog comment commando or other things I could point at if I wanted to depress myself You also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy fat and ugly Putting the word if in front of it doesnt make it any less of an insult Ive tried to be polite to you and will continue to do so but this is the response And please notice like abi Avi is Avraham the admin abi the ML commenter who believes in kindness I counseled against piling on Talk contribs Those are not ad hominem names Karen Yet youve linked to a thread where you and Teresa caled me a psycho You should hear what she said in private when I asked NOT to be spoken of negatively in threads on Making Light Its obvious you two are proTNH and absolutewrite Thats selfinterest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling Well avi can make her own decisons about it then cant sh,0,0

Philosopher RFC philosopher from Wiktionary A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers in the lead This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy only that it is his career Note Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place Definitions Obviously each source is going to use slightly different phrasing Some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent Using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political ethical and theistic specializations in one word which we then elaborate on later in the article philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his Freedomain Radio series libertarian libertarian thinker Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies anarchocapitalist Anarchocapitalism is a political philosophy voluntaryist Voluntaryism or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy athiest Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches ethics Ethics sometimes known as philosophical ethics ethical theory moral theory and moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy Secular ethics Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy Primary source As Stefan Molyneux is a living person we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him obviously we dont want to host any sort of fringe claims If we are to dispute what he says about himself though then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the oldschool philosophers were used to Freedomain Radio About page my Masters Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies I have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my midteens I left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at Freedomain Radio I have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy Freedomain Radio the show that Molyneux hosts has the tagline The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World Molyneuxs books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour UPB A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods A Concise Guide to Atheism and Agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies Strong Atheism The Case for Evacuating the Middle Ground article Why I Am a Philosopher video A response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy An Introduction to Philosophy part video course produced by Molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts Reality Knowledge Truth GodsReligion Ethics and Politics Unsolvable Philosophical Questions Solved video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable Proofs for God Destroyed by a Philosophical Atheist video A Philosophical Review discusses the major philosophical political economic and social developments of video Philosophy Questio,0,0

WikipediaArticles for deletionCheongye Kwan Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me This was the version at the time that you based your post on You posted I just read the article and to be quite honest feel that it does satisfy Wikipedias guidelines it is reliably sourced Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied It now has independent sources And to refute the argument posed by Wayne it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised Please consider the concerns this post raises Simple matters like references notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user and breadandbutter for any admin In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was I dont have a word for it Unreal is close The eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and nonlocalization at the time were Three references from coates robinson shaw certainly before the topic even existed and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event Two references from st half davies white almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topics notability The promoters personal page on his local town website almost certainly selfpublished official village website A casual interview in a nonnotable and possibly nonreliable university magazine apparently of the promoters travels to see experts in a different sport with tangential tiny sentence mention that hed discussed his new sport with them too the Lau Philip LA interview entries marked Reference and support of Written Reference chris cook rhee obviously a request by the founder to a friendcolleague write a letter of support that was never published anyway and isnt cited so you cant have read it not that it was even possibly valid evidence A short writeup of a local information kind on the award of the first black belts by the school in its local paper In brief of the were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage they had precisely zero coverage were claims of personal I think is a great guy letters of support evidently solicited andor written on request with zero evidence of verifiable existence and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent was selfwritten was the briefest of nonmentions in a nonreliable source pretty much I discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview is local press coverage of his courses thats not even news for a day or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall Your assessment of these at AFD was It is reliably sourced styleborderccc solid px width There is barely one reliable source in all of those that the sport even exists in the first place a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first black belts Probably via selfpromotional input There is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest That the cited pages are evidence of notability styleborderccc solid px width They dont mention it or even date from a time the topic existed nor are online versions provided How on earth could they reliably evidence it That the sources are independent styleborderccc solid px width are claims that please support me letters exist they are even stated to be personal references unpublished and uncited is his own clearly selfwritten web page on a local village web host That the cites show it is nonlocalized styleborderccc solid px width The page doesnt list a link so you cant have checked the cite yet you say the citation proves it The reference openly stated Cambridge University and Bristol Taekwando a big indication of its actual source When a link was provided on request it turns out it,0,0

stradbroke galleon portuguese hallo Moondyne I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts knowledge and information The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here There exists in various libraries books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain The fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group ie Hesperian and his friends who are representatives of the mainstream view Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperians mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperians antagonistic attitude simple old fashioned professional jealousy Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates which is a pity but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different Still it is dissapointing Happy trails,0,0

Accents Although the cartoon established Mario and Luigi to be from Brooklyn a fact commonly accepted by fans despite having never been mentioned in any games Toad seemed to speak with a thicker Brooklyn accent The accents werent mentioned in the games but the TV show was presumably a licensed product Until Nintendo decided to go with an Italian accent fans assumed the TV show and later the movie accent was the official standing Only when Nintendos products included digitized recorded speech did anyone realize Nintendo intended them to be Italian not ItalianAmerican Its the same principle of updated canon that Star Trek and Star Wars licensed products run on,0,0

Or between the French and the Walloons Surprise our article on French people clearly labels the Walloon as a distinct ethnic group Perhaps it is best not to make comparisons After screwing it up a few times I have done rewrites of parts of the article mainly a word and a sentence left and right to make the distinction and relation between the Dutch and the Flemish clearer The article switched constantly between parts about the Dutch only and parts about the Dutch and Flemish together This should now be clearer The major thing left to adjust are the graphs of the number of Dutch since these still al include the Flemish,0,0

Why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic Ackoz suggests that because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it I reject such a stance I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky andor controversial Where many Wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe Wikipedias job is to report the truth This is wrong Wikipedias job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is Any attempt to do that is original research Instead of truth Wikipedia aims for verifiability Put a different way Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion not our opinions but those of reliable sources If the truth is clear and uncontroversial it is easy for us to report that If the truth is murky and controversial it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents THE TRUTH and not just one perspective or POV on the topic at hand I have been trying to hit this NPOV sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides Obviously is because some users Jadger and Wikiferdi dont want to discuss in fact they want us to agree with their POV thats not discussion about the NPOV edits Thats why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article talk,0,0
Regarding Loyalmoonie and LGBT categories Looked into it and this editor seems to be pushing an antiLGBT agenda Theyve done similar stuff over at Sailor Moon and made officiallooking warnings to other editors This quote is bizarre and is quite telling To insert those categories would ultimately give other people who may not even support the LGBT movement reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy Sailor Moon is a homosexual andor supports SSM I dont personally watchread Sailor Moon or know much about it so Im not confident enough to readd the categories but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless and there is a sourced part in the article about female homosexualitytalk,0,0

Agreed although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand Obviously if the article is to be written from a supranational perspective at least the Czech experience needs to be included Czechoslovakia being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s had closer ties with the West than Poland did and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was The West politically accepted the countrys territorial mutilation which was not the case with Poland That said I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland the Baltics Yugoslavia or even Ukraine which had never been independent in the first place is a good idea While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war I think that the articles focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue After all there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union too who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy Oct UTC,0,0

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworths involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of brief flirtation would be better I think that the IMG reference needs to be shortsomewhere in the early career sectionposted after the article has been expanded a little otherwise the article might appear weighty I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth But bedsides this brief dalliance with Marxism in an overall consideration of his political career pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article I tried reflecting it as follows His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister who considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by Offriorob above even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworths biography Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be foundwhich I suspect should not be difficultthat it can be reincluded I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle,0,0
Greek love Im looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess Im leaving a note here because you closed this AfD where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article one of whom has used a series of user names unacknowledged on his current user page but available so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the suppress camp I complain here about their coordination Other editors including and I simply cant do it any longer I havent changed my position on the validity of the article but Ive been accused on various talk pages and never the appropriate notice boards of edit warring ownership disruption and even pedophilia by implication all for trying to carry out what the community decided Im done I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively When Ive made a commitment though it grieves me not to keep it Im not asking you to do anything Im just explaining why I cant keep my word as given at the AfD Wow that is a messCertainly no hard feelings on my end it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill not only here but in the real world Sometimes your presence despite your best intentions is harmful rather than helpful and sometimes a dispute just isnt worth it anymore Best of luck in your future endeavors here Mailchimp Im not that bothered but I think that the Mailchimp speedy deletion was a mistake It did cite that it was one of the more important email marketing programs so it was stating the importance something that was supposed to be the original problem The criteria specifies a credible claim of significance Wordpress pages are not reliable sources However I would certainly not object to it being restored as a redirect as it was for several momnths before today Talkback talk Just a hunch Call it my intuition but Im guessing that his username is a direct challenge to patrolling admin that you guys wont block him based on the username itself but his contribution speaks volume of his nonsense louder my other hunch being hes a returning editor than his username does Just my cents Cheers There are plenty of legitimate reasons to be a returning editor the username is not a blatant violation of the policy If you have any evidence of socking file at WPSPI Recreation of article Shay Carl I would like to request that the article Shay Carl be recreated see the deleted TalkShay Carl for my reasons note TalkShay Carl was delete because of A not notibility Well there was,0,0

My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didnt post anything on the article related to my personal experiences That was like the nd day almost two months ago All of my references are verifiableTheres nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation I didnt put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue For instance I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input and in fact asked them to work on the article I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses citing references from a lawyers point of view Those references were deleted by someone I cant remember who and dont know why At this point the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript The guy who runs the blog is a rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts I dont believe that I did any original research All I did is search the Internet for references for the article I really didnt know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF which date back to Also when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway Same as the UN covenantcant really hide that I didnt add a and b together to prove a point at least not consciously Like today I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand who was in the fifth circuit And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se No there was not What I found in the s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business Ive been an entrepreneur I didnt know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I havent got it yet But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state slave state border state Also there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too I think So did the history of workmens comp which is of course related to unions,0,0

When I looked at the Cato edit it was simply a removal of the reference the addition of another donor and a change in the language Without an edit summary to explain the changes were unjustified Your clarification certainly helps Thanks also for adding the reference on Summers Frankly I did not look at the sources removed or added My main concern was the unexplained edits Summaries are important And then I saw that the messages about these same concerns from a while back so my message is more of a reminder Most importantly you are incorrect if you think it is not against the rules to add unsourced material One of the core content policies is WPV and WPRS allows us to carry out that policy Happy editing,0,0

Referring to her as Catherine I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone living or dead by their st names on WP if a female had a title she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie Lady Amy or Lady Dudley for Amy Robsart even though Lady Amy was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after Northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become Lady Dudley until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amys life nor was she then Lady Amy Dudley as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just Amy throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles but was told it was against WP rules though I wasnt pointed to a link for it Noblewomen are usually called by their st names round here as far as I can see even when they have surnames are not of something Mary Boleyn is called Mary not Lady Carey or Lady Stafford Catherine Neville is called Catherine not the Duchess of Norfolk etc theyre not royals As for males I was told they had to be referred to by their title ie Leicester or last name ie Dudley I was banging head on keyboard going but no one just says the king all the time or refers to them as Plantagenet or keeps changing their titles ie Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England So how does Kate get to be consistently referred to as Catherine throughout the article without her title appended Ive only been here a few months I would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me as my main interest is British history I am quite confused,0,0

They are all cunts Its not worth editing articles here concerning any serious issue All sides consist of either people employed to edit or people with very strong opinions that will never ever change They advocate their stance as something that is interesting to them instead of using the encyclopedia as a book of knowledge and contributing what they are sure to know Soon with the centralization of the net into larger and larger sites independent information in general will be extinguished Wikipedia a project that started by nerds and professionals within their set fields will become the altar of knowledge where depth and true insight is sacrificed for becoming the sound magnifier of yellow press and popular science The new tool that is intended to auto translate articles from one Wikipedia to an other will extinguish the few national wikipedias that through their niche provide those of multilingual capacity an ability to crosscheck facts through other perspectives With few small independent sites left with no or few free university pages left real knowledge will be the privilege of the few that know how to use academic search engines and have the money to pay for them,0,0

Camille Paglia sexpositive feminist Here are the supporting links you asked for you stupid twit If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here Camille Paglia On the other hand Ive been saying in public for five years ago as someone whos endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sexpositive experience that Im concerned about the effect on young people people growing up from in a climate where its gone to the opposite direction Im already out there concerned about this so Im really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticismIve been saying this for years that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism Im for eroticism Camille Paglia is a major American social critic Paglias academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history Paglias key importance to sexpositive feminism is not only her writings on sex but her advocacy of traditional values like canon texts Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma a conservative and academic feminist who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture Paglia has in many ways presented a respectable face for prosex feminism to the world at large,1,0

I agree to that many parts of the article is apparently biased madeup bs Examples following Downfall It was common knowledge that de Molay planned on corrupting Catherine of Valois male children by tending to their sorrows then by engaging in acts of anal rape Philip knew the dangers that de Molay represented his own sons were nearly sexually molested by de Molay Upon escaping the vile pervert they confessed to Philip what de Molay had tried to do Myths It is said that Jacques de Molay cursed Philippe le Bel and his descent from his execution pyre a curse which was responded to by Philip shouting in defiance Fuck de Molay It has been speculated that several of the boys whom de Molay had corrupted had grown to enjoy the perversions of the homosexual lifestyle introduced to them Legacy Members are encouraged to model their conduct after his example of loyalty and fidelity instead of the homosexual perversions that de Molay was guilty of himself vile pervert homosexual perversions sheesh Could someone SANE please clean up this article,1,0

unblockDISCLAIMER I do not identify as a Nazi NeoNazi Facist NeoFascist I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter I do not hate Jews in fact I have many jewish friends Hello although this is technically an unblock appeal it is really only a reason to explain you wont be in a mood to unblock me when Im finished talking First of all I want to apologise I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page This is the reason for that I have a few Jewish friends and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that I never really make jokes about the holocaust because that never go over well with them and it is not nice well apparently a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew but claims he is now he thinks I am a facist nazi and I hate jews i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage Second of all i would like to ask why it is not permissable to self identify as a nazi There are several userboxes dealing with this subject There is even a userbox that states This user identifies as a Hitlerist WHAT THE HELL You will let people say they support Hitler but you wont let them say they are nazis Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy But if you are hitlerist that obviously says you support all that your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews well if you are taking that into account then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist That can be extremely offensive to christians if you want me to I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia with reference of a nice book I think I will one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room You were then forced to excrete over everyone You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it It was alright if you stood perfectly still but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up They would do that for hours on end Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ the holocaust was horrible but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences so could you ban all communists please My last comment is in response to Chzzs question about me making the gay comment statement Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings one is homosexuality and the other is wierd stupid dumb i was using the second connotation maybe if you people didnt spend so much time on this gay sorry stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words Even if you unblock me which you wont I will take a wikibreak i dont want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life i have already recieved a punishment never becoming an admin the whole gay sorry dumb trust thing just know this i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay sorry dumb policy you have lost a serious editor this whole thing has really annoyed me PS Chzz I have been on Wikipedia for years you think I forgot to sign my gay sorry stupid post yeah right,1,0

It wasnt Mkil just someone sick of all your hT And just for future reference learn how to write before you make edits to an encyclopedia you make yourself look like a fool because your illiterate And SIGN your posts Youve been making harrassing edits for years and you even failed at that Such a simple thing as signing your posts and you still cant get it right Ill bet you were dropped on your head as a child werent you No need to answer that your writing style gives it away,1,0
I caught you vandalizing a page on wikipedia Normally right now id block you but you happen to pull this shit while Im in a transitional period so I dont wanna block you I wanna help you You see the path of the righteous wikipedian is beset on allsides by the inequalities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men So basically dont be such a dick and fuck up wikipedia I worked really hard creating and maintaining this website and many people enjoy my invetnion without causing such harm But you sir you are a different animal I dont think Ive ever caught anyway vandalizing wikipedia before You sir are a true original A true renegade Your so bad ass I cant think straight Im all bendy and shit and this fervor is giving me the vapors Please brother sister or inbetween dont mess up wikipedia think about the children and do like the cats in my neigborhood do shit in the sandbox,1,0
Imagine if I treated Hapfsjen like you treated this anon editor here We both know his English is poor and his comprehension is poor But when I see his messy edits I leave them alone to avoid conflict But you Drmies you treat people like shit Like you I want to delete this article period by period comment in the talk page of an academic and holocaust survivor You dont get to act to like an antisemite and bully people you disagree with and then cry foul when editors point out that you are abusive Your actions speak for themselves You first actions as an admin were to impost your POV on a contentious article And you statement that you dont want to block me is a blatant lie you have said just the opposite in the past and participated in accusations of socking to try and get me blocked indefinitely This is on top of our long running conflict So you lie as much as you want and you can block me if I point out the facts that demonstrate youre a liar but bigotry bullying bias prejudice discrimination and other abuses are wrong Im limited to how much I can speak out about your actions because perversely speaking out against the worst abuses on Wikipedia is punishable But the facts speak for themselves,1,0

Looking for a conversation we had Wanting to reingnite an argument long since resolved but cant find it Or maybe you just want to read what Ive said so that you can use it in a fresh argument against me Maybe youre a scientist doing research on how a yr old workshy Yorkshireman interacts with a a and a when discussing very trivial Beatlesrelated matters using various and increasingly confusing pseudonyms Then why not look in my archives Theyre full of hilarious altercations Ive had with friends and critics and will keep you entertained for hours Why not try the random discussion generator by entering an archive and choosing a random heading then reading the relevant text its pot luck madness Or maybe youre a publisher looking for a new form of coffee table literature with a view to making one lucky stubborn and argumentative wikipedia contributer a household name Look no further God has smiled upon you this day I am your man More likely youre an admin looking to see how many times Ive been blocked before so you can give me a really big block becuase Ive called a fellow wikipedian a fucking useless tosser Ill kill you let me save you some time I have never once been blocked yes that ought to do What a good cover,1,0
Edit request from June Mauler is a shit faggot,1,0
no seriousy the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that if i really had my way half of you would be shot ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much much better off if of the population died tomorrow that doesnt mean i go around killing people or making specific death threats against individuals and dont you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT JUST GO DIE ALREADY that they probably dont want you to die or more accurately they dont care Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people And I am not one of those people If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am edit which was on a wiki talk page is probably not the best Granted nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like and and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages as well as central asian former soviet republics and even Mongolia So I called someone an idiot BOO FUCKING HOO maybe he could have said What language is that instead of assuming that it was Russian However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot I can guarantee you that I was at least times as insulted by him calling that Russian I am a proud native Russian and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what a spelling correction Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers cant spell Dont even think about raising issue of my use of the word I live in Harlem Around here that word is used like a comma And before you try to tell me the difference between nigga and nigger there is none Its called a dialect While for some purposes it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them I find it is usually clearer to spell properly Also a nigger to me at least is not a black person I am not a racist I do not even draw distinctions between people In my holy opinion there is a nigger inside of all of us People like you for instance who take offense for no reason i mean was saying black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society tarred and feathered strung up on trees dragged through town by their enormous wangs etc No And if that is what you heard Id like to know why Are you black of the black people I know personally use the word nigger more than I do are why we as a society still cant get over the silly idea that words are harmful Words are not harmful Ideas are harmful One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all You want to end racism forever Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word nigger SERIOUSLY I happen to be a Priest and a Docktor and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities Fucks like you make me hate it but I still do it Thats what a good person I am I forgot what else I was going to complain about I mean I could complain about everything on Wikipedia not because I am uncivil but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal welladjusted individuals such as myself If you look at all my page edits they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA Ok there was one tiny exception a long time ago I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to Winston Churchill Someone else reverted it and I reverted it back I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong but I only do what is right That is why I put it on my user page I dont do wrong things If you try to argue with me you will be in for a world of hurt Butthurt to be exact But you have nobody to blame but yourself Unlike you I actually warn people first But no You fags have to be humorless oversensitive fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted selfimportance and your administrative powers Well you can go fuck yourselves IF you ever succeed in getting all sand out of your vaginas I joined wikipedia because i wanted to make it better and that was all i did but i guess you cunts actually enjoy bathing aro,1,0

This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors like all other forms of symbolism to do this Thus the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty but rather a way to communicate you dolt,1,0

Something anonymous editing has given rise to Vandalism Manifesto Pass to all Wikians VANDALISM IS GOOD Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm Vandals do their thing all over Wiki from frustration and hatred because incompetent editors who have no skills no degrees no expertise usually no names have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others Vandalism is a good and natural response to nolifers as in Get a Life who do edits edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of or more and are proud of it These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized over and over as long as they are in effect vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop Vandals keep nolife editors admins bureaucrats and stewards honest or at least busy reverting the reverts they get on their own pages VANDALISM IS GOOD It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns The Culture of Wikipedia is veryvery sick and Vandals are needed to cull the herd SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL Vandal God,1,0

You know I was thinking Nobody really attacked me before I revealed my age here After I announced that I was I was subject to a constant storm of harassment and abuse The same thing goes for when I was on The Sandbox when I was Before people knew my age they didnt care After I told them my age they hated me Its just so amusing how the idiot Soapboxers think of teenagers as being responsible for the decline of The Soapbox like it was ever any good to begin with This is funny because the adults are the dumbest people here Mauricio Chuppah Redneckgirl Pinky Scooby GG ForeverLostTinkerbell greenrabbit StarRocketsInFlight BreeRobinson enigma CocaineNightmares TokyoDome ChadOchoCinco Steve Lake all adults The teenage posters here are typically the smartest ones Lets see GDawg HeadBangingBrunette ClassicAge Metropolis even though hes a bipolar weirdo ChrisScript just to name a few All I ever see adults posting is rate my poo my ballz smell funny whoz hawter me or ur mom i like to rape little girls and HEY GUYZ LOOK AT ME IM AN ATTENTION WHORE The adult posters here are immature moronic savage bullies with the mental capacity of a retarded yearold Whereas most of the teenagers here are thoughtful intelligent mature and often profound But theyre subject to constant schoolyard bullying by the idiot adult posters who think theyre somehow superior because they were born and dropped on their head earlier Soapbox logic never fails to amuse me,2,0
